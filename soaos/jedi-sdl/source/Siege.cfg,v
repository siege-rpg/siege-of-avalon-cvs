1.2
log
@All projects ( win32 and jedi-sdl ) have now been changed so that in AniDemo.pas the Game and GameMap objects are now created dynamically, so there is no need to install any components now to be able to compile and play the game. Thanks to Allan who pointed out the errors of dynamic creation ways.
